				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am generating different sequences of a spacy odyssey/adventure in which you have to rescue a missing crew.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I analyzed the given template and built off of its creative foundation, along with incorporating some of my own personal interests to create a generator that feels more true to what I am interested in. Then followed the proper editing of the js and index.html files in order to make my generator work, along with setting up Github desktop so that I can push my work to my portfolio website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Personally, I found struggle with incorporating the index.html file so that it would properly show on my portfolio website, and I also ran into Git-related trouble. When it came to editing on Glitch, I ran into little struggle, as I found the given template to be very helpful. I had a lot of fun with incorporating space-related fiction into my generator, and I hope that I can share my love for space with other people!</p>
