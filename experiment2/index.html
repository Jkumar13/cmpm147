				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment generates an image that reflects a space-themed background: https://cdn.glitch.global/cd0095cb-a83f-4bdc-a778-e789344810a0/space%20background.png?v=1713336352521.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
				Relation to the image:
					- Color: The large planet in the center of the galaxy is mostly blue and also contains the orange fissure in its center. The mountain range on the planet surface contains a brown base, along with darker-grey mountain ranges.
					- Primitives: The planets are generated with circle() calls.
					- Polygons: The mountain range is a combination of two polygons that use vertex calls. The first polygon represents the planet's surface and the second represents the spiky mountain ranges, thus creating a sort of layering effect.
					- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountain ranges and differently positioned planets in space.
					- Life: The position of the planets changes over time as to simulare orbital movement of the planets from your view. You can also use your mouse to accelerate the orbit of these planets.
